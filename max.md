Based in Brooklyn, New York, I am the A1 engineer at Soho House New York, in the meatpacking district. You can hear below some selections from different performances I’ve run sound for, using classic NY mixing techniques and an attitude of care and precision. I'm also available for live sound on appointment.

-Bandcamp mix of live recordings- (I'm putting this together)


I also run recording & mixing projects - here are some samples of projects I’ve recorded & mixed for NY musicians. I work in Reaper and Ableton, though I am proficient in Protools. I record at East Side Sound, an excellent hidden live room in Chinatown, and Contusion Studio in Bushwick. I also have a selection of outboard analog processing equipment, and love working with musicians to make mixes sound great, while adding some creative production elements.

-Bandcamp mix of studio sessions (Bear Waller, GCC,)


Finally, I’m a musician myself - you can find me on Spotify as Dirt Eater, and check out my first bands album ‘Some Kind of Cowboy’. Forthcoming is an album from my current project with Josh Breslauer. [Die Boskop](http://dreyerprojects.info/dieboskop/) is a two piece psychedelic grunge band with deep progressive roots.
