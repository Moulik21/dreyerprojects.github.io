Hyperluxer is a 3 piece rock band from Bushwick, in Brooklyn, New York. They play grungey Americana and fuzzed out garage psych with guitar, bass and drums, and not a whole lot else. Adrienne Lloyd plays bass, shredding both a classic Rickenbacker and an upright bass. Max Dreyer plays guitar, switching between a heavily modded Epiphone SG and The Loar's P-90 archtop. Having recently lost their longtime drummer to the clarion call of the west, they are seeking a new drummer.
