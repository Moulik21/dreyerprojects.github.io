Nicholas Maximilian Dreyer is a composer, songwriter, guitarist, recording & mixing engineer, and producer, living and working in New York City's vibrant Chinatown. He works at East Side Sound, an old New York studio hidden in the East Village, doing recording & production projects, as well as occasional session jobs playing electric & acoustic guitar.

He grew up in the Blue Ridge Mountains, playing fiddle from an early age, before moving on to electric guitar in his teen years. He earned a BA in composition & electronic sound design from the University of Virginia, working with composers such as Alvin Lucier, Pauline Oliveros, Matmos, and many others. Steeped in the history of recorded music, he left for Shanghai for four years, where he played guitar at weddings during the day and in seedy nightclubs after the sun went down. Now, in New York City, he records local bands, mixes & masters albums, fronts a rock trio, and builds analogue audio electronics, from simple guitar pedals, to complex modular synthesizers.

Composition

With a degree in composition, and an ear for sonic textures, Max finds himself composing soundscapes and scores quite often - for films, luxury events, and promotions. 

Arrangement

Since age 13, Max has been creating arrangements, both for his own music, and to help other songwriters flesh out their ideas. Below are a few examples of songs arranged and produced by Max - from a simple acoustic guitar and voice, to bass, drums, keyboards - the palette available to a recording artist is more varied than it ever has been.

Mixing/Mastering

Working at East Side Sound, Max has access to high-level professional equipment, with which to fine tune recordings, and imbue them with the sonic breadth that allows them to be their best selves, in any audio context. Examples below.
