Bandcamp Tracks

Die Boskop is a two piece rock band based in Brooklyn, New York. Drawing on prog rock, grunge, and the storytelling of Appalachian ballads, we write songs aboute times, places, and states of mind.

Max (guitar & vocals) and Josh (drums & bass) have been writing and refining the sounds of the boskop with a philosophy of duality and balance. We both bring very different things - Max has a background in sound engineering, technology, and design, whereas Josh comes from the world of theory and musical structure.
