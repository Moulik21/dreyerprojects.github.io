Hyperluxer is a 3 piece rock band from Bushwick, in Brooklyn, New York. They play grungey Americana and fuzzed out garage psych with guitar, bass, and drums, and not a whole lot else. Adrienne Lloyd plays bass, shredding both a classic Rickenbacker and an upright bass. Max Dreyer plays guitar, switching between a heavily modded Epiphone SG and The Loar's P-90 archtop. Recordings and concert dates coming soon. Look forward to:

Concerts in NYC and beyond.
An EP available for free download.
Partnership with NYC design collective Swanky Savages.
